# 👋 Hi, I'm Amit Padhan

### Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Linux Power User | Python Developer

I am a B.Tech student with a strong focus on **Cybersecurity**, **Linux systems**, and **backend development**. I focus on ethical hacking, Linux internals, networking, and hands-on labs. I don’t just study concepts — I implement them, test them, and build projects around them. I enjoy breaking systems to understand how to secure them.

## 🧠 What I'm Doing & Learning

- 🔐 **Cybersecurity Practice:** Active on **TryHackMe** and **HackTheBox** sharpening web exploitation and privilege escalation skills. Performing lab-based vulnerability analysis and exploring ethical hacking methodologies.
- 📡 **Networking & Systems:** Studying Computer Networks (TCP/IP, OSI, subnetting, DNS resolution) and Database Systems (SQL, relational DBs).
- 🐧 **Linux & System-Level Work:** Using **Arch Linux** as my daily driver (Hyprland, Wayland). Writing system automation using Bash, managing custom dotfiles, and building persistent Arch Linux USB installations.
- 🤖 **Development Projects:** Building an AI virtual assistant (Python, Encrypted keys), a browser-based AI chatbot architecture, learning socket programming in Python, and exploring custom Android-x86 ISO builds and bootloader unlocking.
